## Sample Q&A Responses

**Q: How accurate is the accident detection?**
A: The sensor fusion approach (accelerometer + gyroscope) can detect collisions above 30 m/s². In
production, we'd add ML models trained on real accident data for higher accuracy.

**Q: Can this work without internet?**
A: Yes! After the initial model download, all AI inference runs on-device. Only real-time traffic
would need connectivity, but we have offline fallbacks.

**Q: How does it handle multiple simultaneous emergencies?**
A: The Master Orchestrator queues and prioritizes emergencies. Critical cases get processed first
with faster routes. Each agent can handle multiple requests concurrently.

**Q: What about patient privacy?**
A: All processing happens on-device. No patient data is sent to external servers. The on-device AI
ensures HIPAA-compliant privacy.

**Q: Can this integrate with real hospital systems?**
A: Absolutely! The architecture uses a modular design. The current mock data can be replaced with
real hospital APIs, blood bank systems, and traffic APIs.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**
A: After initial development, operational costs are minimal - just device hosting and optional API
calls. The on-device AI eliminates expensive cloud inference costs.
